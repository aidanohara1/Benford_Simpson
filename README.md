# Benford_Simpson

2023may13: HW  -- Adding Readme to keep track of changes
 - Today mostly literature review
 - Now we have examples of multiple recent articles on Benford to see how they present material that is mostly well-trod ground
 - From inside the world of Benford-Newcomb research bubble, it looks like everyone and his dog knows all about Benford 
 - But that's not how it looks from not-too-far outside the bubble.  So I think papers about applciations and teaching Benford would sell.
